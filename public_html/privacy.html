<p>We respect your privacy. TL;DR: Mia doesn't track you or transfer your data to third parties. Also, we wrote this Privacy Policy in plain English, so you don't need a PhD in law to understand it.</p>
<h2>What information do we collect</h2>
<p>The bare minimum. It's only the telemetry data that we track. We don't collect Translation history. We don't request and don't collect personally-identifiable information.<br><br>Telemetry data is anonymous data that shows us which buttons are clicked, which features are used, and by how many people. Again, no personally-identifiable information is collected. This only helps us understand the overall user behavior and is vital in product design.<br><br>We use Amplitude Analytics in Mac apps for this purpose. They have never been involved in privacy scandals. We don't use Google Analytics.<br><br>Also we use Sentry for bug reporting. No personally-identifiable information is collected.<br><br>The application uses Google Translate to translate text and pages. Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the app: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>No, we don't use it.</p>
<h2>Your payment credentials</h2>
<p>We don't store and have access to any of your payment details. If you're purchasing Mia from the App Store, Apple handles purchases for us.</p>
<h2>Browser permissions to all pages</h2>
<p>You may find it suspicious that all Mia's browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge) request permission to access all visited web pages as well as browsing history. It's the permission that enables us to inject translation scripts to all pages. Those scripts help you translate full websites, highlight text on sites and translate it with a simple shortcut, or by double-clicking. Long story short, it's Mia's killer feature â€“ on-page translations.<br><br>Browser vendors named this permission a little misleading. We're also bitter about it. We don't access your history. We don't keep track of the pages you visited. Injecting translations scripts is literally the only thing we're using from that permission.</p>
